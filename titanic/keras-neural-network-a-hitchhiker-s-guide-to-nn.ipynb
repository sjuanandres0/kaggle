    "\n",
    "Don't panic!! This notebook will give an introduction for machine learning (ML) beginners on how to implement and optimize a simple artificial neural network (ANN) for data classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we will apply a state-of-the-art ML framework for building and training deep learning models - the Keras API for TensorFlow 2 - to one of the most famous data sets for ML beginners: the Kaggle competition \"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster\". The goal of this challenge is to create a ML model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook, we will put a focus on how to systematically optimize and evaluate an ANN model - two very important aspects if you want to obtain a well performing artificial neural network. We will learn, step by step, how to optimize the hyperparameters of an ANN using GridSearch and cross-validation. Moreover, we are going to discuss in detail how to evaluate the quality of an ANN, analyzing e.g. the confusion matrix and the feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we will see that a simple ANN performs very well as a classifier on the titanic dataset (top 2% on the competition leaderboard and with 83.3% test score one of the best ANNs published for this competition) and outperforms strong ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting (80.8% test score, see Appendix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the detailed introduction to modeling with ANNs, the notebook includes standard techniques for feature analysis and engineering and shows how to prepare the data for the modeling process using pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you enjoy the notebook and, of course, I am always happy to get some comments and feedback.\n",

    "#### Competition Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n"

    "The only numerical feature that strongly correlates with *Survived* is *Fare*. This might be explaind by the fact that the cabins of the richer passengers were mainly located in the upper parts of the boat, which was not directly fluted after the Titanic hit the iceberg. Moreover, the richer passengers were first to go on the life boats. \n",

    "Most passengers embarked in Southampton - one half 3rd class, the other half 1st and 2nd class passengers. The majority of the passengers which embarked in Cherbourg traveled in the 1st class, which explains the higher survival probability of this passenger group. It is remarkable that in Queenstwon mainly 3rd class passengers embarked, however, their survival probability is higher than for the passengers which embarked in Southamton. This might be relevant information."

    "In this notebook I will not further analyze these two features. As mentioned above discussing the feature *Fare*, the feature *Ticket* is very valuble to find groups that share the same ticket to correct the fare prices and implement the new *FareCorr*. Apart from that some tikets habe a letter which refers to the deck/level. Analyzing this together with the feature *Cabin*, where most of the entries are missing (or where the passengers had no cabin?!?), one could construct a new feature containing information about the survival probability regarding the deck/level. For more info have a look at the [wiki entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic)."

The idea is to find groups of poeple, e.g. familes (share the same LastName/Ticket) or people that just travel together (share same Ticket). If the majority of this group survived, the feature FamilySurvival is set to 1. If the majority died, it is set to 0. For all other passengers which can not be associated with a group are, FamilySurvival is set to 0.5."

To this end, we use [PermutationImportance](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blackbox/permutation_importance.html) which is capable of computing feature importances for a number of black-box estimators by measuring how the score decreases when a feature is not available. in concrete, the feature importances is computed as mean decrease of the score when a feature is permuted, i.e. substitued by noise. \n",

    "In the previous section, we have already seen how to build a pretty good ANN classifer. However, the hard part of getting a top classifier is to find the optimum set of hyperparameters. And this is what we are going to do now. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the optimization process I went through the following steps using GridSearchCV:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting the activation function and the respective kernel initializer\n",
    "As the activation function for the hidden layers I chose the scaled exponential linear unit function *SELU* with the respective LeCun initialization. Using the [*SELU*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02515) the network will self-normalize, where the output of each layer will preserve a mean of 0 and std of 1 during the training. This is in particular benefitial for deep networks which may face problems with vanishing/exploding gradients. For our rather shallow model this should not be a problem, nevertheless, the *SELU* performed at least 0.5% better than *ElU* or *ReLU* for different hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Finding the best Optimizer\n",
    "I tried a number of different optimizers (see parameter grid below) and adtaptive moment estimation with the method, aka [*Nadam*](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/054_report.pdf), turned out to be the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluationg the optimum learning\n",
    "The learing rate is the most likely the most important parameter. There are several techniqus to optimize the learing rate like ploting the learning curve for various learning rates or using elaborate methods like [*1cycle sheduling*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820). I tried several techniques, but for our rather simple model it was most practical to try different learning rates using GridSearchCV. I found a learning rate of 0.0005 (half the default value for Nadam) to deliver the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optimizing the number of epochs\n",
    "Having found a good learning rate, one has to optimize the number of epochs per training run. I found 30 epochs to be a good number not to overfit the model. In general, to prevent overfitting one can use techniques like EarlyStopping or plot/compare the training vs the validation loss/score for a series of epochs (discussed below).\n",
    "I implemented EarlyStopping with a callback for GridSearchCV (see below), however, it was more practical to simply optimze the epochs and check that the training and the validation score do not diverge with increasing epochs. Especially, since with *patience* one introduces another hyperparameter which has to be optimized. Moreover, it should be noted that before using EarlyStopping whith cross-validation, [a few things](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48127550/early-stopping-with-keras-and-sklearn-gridsearchcv-cross-validation) should to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finding the optimum batch size \n",
    "Again I used GridSearchCV and found 20 instances to be the best batch size. In general, what is the maximum batch size one should use is still under discussion. There are several controverse discussions in the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Find the best model architecture:\n",
    "GridSearchCV found three combinations to be very similar in performance: #layers/#neurons: 3/10, 3/15, 2/10. \n",
    "The score of the three models lay within 0.3%. In the end I chose 2 hidden layers with 10 neurons each, since it performed best on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can optimze the hyperparameters by running GridSearch for all different parameters at once, which might take quite a while or find the best parameters by optimizing only one or a few parameters at a time and see how the model performs. Using the latter step-by-step method, it should be noted that one might have to go several times through the different steps in order to find the optimum parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here is the GridSearchCV approach using a KerasClassifier:"

With the current set of features, the ANN classifier performs much better than strong ensemble methods like *Random Forests* and *Gradient Boosting* which only achieved about 80.8% on the test data. An analysis of both classifiers can be found in appedix A and B of this notebook.\n",

It should be noted that for a rather small dataset, as it is the case for the *Titanic Desaster*, it is not advisable to create a separate validation data set from the training data (tried it, model does not generalize well anymore), so using cross-validation is essential.\n",

Below you will see that despite a optimization with GridSearchCV, none of the the two methodes achieved higher sores than 80.8% on the test data set. Hence, with 83.3% test score, the rather simple ANN we discussed above performes much better.\n",
